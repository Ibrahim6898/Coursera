# Difference betweeen Inline and External Stylesheet.

    In practice, web developers often use external stylesheets for larger projects to promote maintainability and reusability, while inline styles may be used for specific, one-time styling needs or for quick prototyping.
    
  Inline Stylesheet:

1.  Location: Inline styles are defined directly within the HTML document. They are placed using the `style` attribute within HTML tags. For example:

   ```html
   <p style="color: red;">This is a red text.</p>
   ```

2. Scope: Inline styles apply only to the specific HTML element they are defined within. They do not affect other elements on the page.

3. Usage: Inline styles are useful for making quick, specific style changes to individual elements. However, they are not recommended for extensive styling across an entire website.

External Stylesheet:

1. Location: External stylesheets are separate files with a `.css` extension that contain all the CSS rules for a website. They are linked to HTML documents using the `<link>` element within the document's `<head>`. For example:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
   ```

2. Scope: External stylesheets can affect the styling of multiple HTML elements across an entire website. They allow for consistent and centralized styling.

3. Usage: External stylesheets are the preferred method for maintaining and organizing styles in larger projects. They promote code reusability, separation of concerns, and easier maintenance.

Key Differences:

1. Location: The main difference is where the CSS rules are defined. Inline styles are placed directly within HTML tags, while external stylesheets are stored in separate CSS files.

2. Scope: Inline styles affect only the specific element they are applied to, while external stylesheets can affect multiple elements across an entire website.

3. Usage: Inline styles are suitable for quick, one-off style changes, but they can lead to code duplication and maintenance challenges in larger projects. External stylesheets are ideal for maintaining a consistent and organized style across a website.
